# rosenpy
RosenPy is a complex-valued neural network library, written in Python; Incorporates CVNNs such as CV-FFNN (complex-valued feedforward neural network), SC-FFNN (split-complex feedforward neural network), CV-RBFNN (com-plex-valued radial basis function neural network), FC-RBFNN (fully-complex radial basis function neural network), and Deep PT-RBFNN (deep phase transmittance radial basis function neural network); and It enables the incorporation of properties intrinsic to neural networks, such as momentum, L2 regularization, early stopping, mini-batch, and learning rate decay.
